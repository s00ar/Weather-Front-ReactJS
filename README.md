Requirements:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Basic understanding of ReactJS, Sass, and React Context.

Obtain a Weather API Key:

You'll need an API key from a weather service like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI to fetch weather data. Create an account on their website and obtain your API key.

Create an Environment File:

Create a file named .env in the project root directory.

Add the following line, replacing <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual API key:

REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
Important: Never commit your API key to version control.
